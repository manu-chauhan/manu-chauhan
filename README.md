## Hi there 👋

<!--
**MANU-CHAUHAN/manu-chauhan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Multiple stuff but mostly it revolves around Python, Deep Learning, RL & sometimes Classical ML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/reading: wherever my curiosity takes me
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Deep Learning, basic/general psychology, and tech of course
- ⚡ The big question: Where are the aliens? 🤔 🪐

  ✨✨✨✨✨
